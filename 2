<h1>Study Spanish Quetzaltenango Guatemala</h1><p>&nbsp;The Regular Spanish Immersion Program at Casa Xelajú in Quetzaltenango (Xela), Guatemala, offers one-on-one Spanish instruction combined with a full cultural immersion experience. Students live with local host families, participate in daily cultural activities and weekend excursions, and follow a standardized Spanish I–IV curriculum with a downloadable syllabus. This program is ideal for learners who prefer a gradual but immersive approach to mastering the Spanish language.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Upon arrival, each student undergoes an initial assessment, after which the teacher prepares a weekly lesson plan using the GANAG template. The plan includes linguistic objectives, daily lessons, evaluations, homework, and assignments. Casa Xelajú’s teachers are extensively trained to encourage active participation through student-centered instruction, ensuring learners are fully engaged in the language acquisition process. Each teacher is also equipped with a laptop to integrate technology into lessons for a more dynamic classroom experience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;For students with limited time, the school offers an accelerated Spanish program with a faster pace and additional homework. Those seeking a more traditional approach may opt for Spanish for Travelers, which allows customization according to personal preferences, or a program designed specifically for retirees. College students or teachers can enroll in the Academic Program to earn college credits, while advanced learners can focus on mastering the Spanish subjunctive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The teaching methodology at Casa Xelajú follows Stephen Krashen’s “Comprehensive Input” model. Lessons progress through a structured process: topic introduction, rule formation by the student, feedback and discussion, multimedia engagement, oral and written practice, quizzes, and evaluation, followed by reinforcement through homework and testing. The school aligns its curriculum with the American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages (ACTFL) standards, which are recognized internationally for their academic rigor and quality.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Casa Xelajú’s instructors bring over 35 years of teaching experience and are fully licensed by Guatemala’s Ministry of Education. They combine professionalism and enthusiasm to create an enriching learning atmosphere. For intermediate and advanced students, Casa Xelajú also offers specialized courses focusing on contemporary Guatemalan issues such as genocide, repression, mining, poverty, and corruption, providing students with a historical and social understanding of the country.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Part of each student’s tuition supports community development projects, including funding computer labs and internet services for rural schools in Aldea Francisco Vela, Nuevo Palmarcito, Caserio Guadalupe, and La Pedrera. To date, the school has donated more than 60 computers and 20 musical instruments, helping over 400 children access computer education and collectively saving families around $40,000 annually.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The institution offers over 45 Spanish courses, including test preparation for DELE, OPI, Praxis II, BCLAD, TOPT, FSI, SAT II, CLEP, MTEL, and more. Casa Xelajú also holds academic agreements with two major U.S. universities, allowing its programs to meet international academic standards.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Classes are conducted one-on-one in private study rooms free from distractions, with beautiful views of the city. Each program includes five hours of instruction per day, five days a week, homestay accommodation with three daily meals, and access to cultural activities, lectures, and excursions. Students also enjoy free Wi-Fi, organic coffee, tea, and bread during breaks, access to the school’s extensive library with over 1,000 books and 200 films, and affordable international calls through the school’s U.S. phone line.</p>
