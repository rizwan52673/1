<h1>Hike Volcán Santa Maria Quetzaltenango Guatemala</h1><p>&nbsp;Casa Xelaju is offering a hiking trip to Volcan Santa Maria, one of Guatemala’s most challenging volcanoes. Also known as Gagxanul in the K’iche’ language, it is located south of Quetzaltenango and rises 12,375 feet (3,772 meters) above sea level. The climb to the summit can take up to four hours, with a descent of two to three hours. The hike is very demanding due to both the steep terrain and high altitude, so good physical and cardio condition is essential.</p><iframe width="100%" height="550" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-Af7qrsJq4k" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>&nbsp;From Quetzaltenango, the group is transported by bus to the edge of the village of Llanos del Pinal, where the climb begins. The first section leads through moderately difficult terrain until reaching La Meseta, the base of the volcano cone. Along the way, hikers are treated to spectacular views of Quetzaltenango and the surrounding areas.</p><a href="https://www.casaxelaju.com/hiking-volcan-santa-maria-guatemala/"><b><span style="font-size: x-large;">Hike Volcán Santa Maria Quetzaltenango Guatemala</span></b></a><br />
<p>&nbsp;Reaching the summit reveals panoramic sights of the highlands, more than twenty volcanoes, the lowlands, and Volcano Santiaguito. The rocky summit has become a ceremonial site where visitors may witness evangelical or Mayan rituals. Overnight accommodation is available in Casa Xelaju’s conference hall at no extra cost, though a sleeping bag is required.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The hike requires a minimum of two people, with a fee of Q230.00 for the morning departure at 5:00 AM or Q260.00 for the midday departure. Hikers should bring a very good flashlight, hiking shoes, a winter coat, a backpack, plenty of water, snacks, and toilet paper, as the volcano experiences microclimates and the peak can be very cold.</p>
