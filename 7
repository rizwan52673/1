<h1>Hike Volcano Santiaguito Cone Quetzaltenango Guatemala</h1><p>&nbsp;Hiking the Volcán Santiaguito Cone in Guatemala is truly a once-in-a-lifetime experience, offering the chance to witness one of the most active volcanoes in the world. The hike begins in the town of Santa María de Jesús and typically takes about three and a half hours. Along the trail, hikers encounter wildflowers, untouched vegetation, sweeping views of the lowlands, and the distant Pacific Ocean. The landscape feels timeless, as much of it has remained unchanged for centuries.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Standing at an elevation of 3,771.9 meters (12,375 feet), Volcán Santiaguito sits at the southern base of Volcán Santa María, within a mountainous region near the city of Quetzaltenango. The volcano features a complex of four rocky lava domes, one of which—known as Fuego (Fire)—is the active dome. Every hour or so, it produces a powerful explosion followed by a massive plume of smoke that can rise as high as eight kilometers into the sky.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The journey begins early in the morning, departing at 3:30 a.m. from the main building and continuing by bus to the town of Santa María de Jesús in Zunil. The cost of the hike is $70 for one or two people, $60 for a group of three, and $80 for groups of four or five. The trip includes a professional hiking guide, public transportation from the city to Llanos del Pinal, purified water at the building (participants should bring their own bottles), and the park entrance fee. Tips are not included.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Hikes depart daily, and all profits go directly to La Pedrera Community Project, a non-profit organization that supports over 60 children with after-school tutoring and computer classes. More information can be found at www.lapedreraschoolproject.com</p>
<p>&nbsp;Participants are advised to bring snacks, plenty of water, a sweater or fleece, a windbreaker jacket, hiking shoes, and a camera to capture the breathtaking scenery. The early hours of the hike can be quite chilly, but temperatures will rise as the day progresses.</p>
<p>&nbsp;In addition to this trip, other hiking options are available, including Volcán Santa María, Laguna de Chicabal, and the trek from Xela to Lake Atitlán. Casa Xelajú, with more than 30 years of experience, offers Spanish immersion programs, apartment rentals, and guided hiking tours. It is recognized as the only socially responsible travel organization in Guatemala with an A+ rating from the Better Business Bureau.</p>
