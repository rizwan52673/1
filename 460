<p>&nbsp;The Spanish summer adventure in Quetzaltenango, lasting either three or two weeks, is designed specifically for teachers, administrators, and others working in education. Its purpose is to help school personnel gain the ability to communicate more confidently with Latino families. The next trip is scheduled for June 28 to July 19, 2026, and will be chaperoned by Julio E. Batres and Betsy May. A virtual meeting is planned for February 14 at 1:00 PM CST.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The program focuses on Spanish language development while deepening participants’ cultural understanding of Latino students living in the United States. Participants will learn useful expressions commonly used by students and their families and will also have the chance to visit schools in both rural and urban communities. CX offers a distinctive curriculum for intermediate to advanced students who want to explore current events in Guatemala. Studying these topics introduces historical context shaped by internal and external influences affecting Guatemalan society into the 21st century. The program also provides Spanish test preparation for those needing to pass proficiency exams required for a teaching license. Educational tours for educators are available during the summer, and additional program materials such as the flyer and video can be accessed online.</p><iframe width="100%" height="550" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/p-9p88gbjL8" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>&nbsp;Participants may earn up to sixteen undergraduate college credits in Spanish or 125 continuing education units. Information is available for the 2025 summer dates, chaperones, and a sample calendar of activities. Fund for Teachers is offering grants to educators and administrators participating in the Spanish program in Quetzaltenango, and inquiries can be directed to Perrin Worrell.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The program recognizes the challenges educators face when learning a second language in the United States, especially considering demanding workloads. Total immersion helps accelerate learning and enriches the experience by offering direct exposure to Spanish-speaking culture. Traveling abroad to study can feel intimidating even for experienced travelers, but Casa Xelajú helps make the process comfortable. Its faculty and staff create an enjoyable learning environment and are genuinely committed to helping students integrate into the language and culture of Guatemala.
