<p>&nbsp;Hiking Volcán Santiaguito is a once-in-a-lifetime experience, allowing hikers to witness the dramatic activity of this powerful volcano. With an elevation of 3,771.9 meters (12,375 feet), it is located on the southern foothills of Volcán Santa María, surrounded by rugged mountains near the city of Quetzaltenango. In 1902, the area experienced one of the largest volcanic eruptions in history, which destroyed several villages to the south.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Today, the volcano is made up of a complex of four rocky lava domes. One of these, known as Fuego, is the active dome and regularly produces strong explosions followed by massive clouds of smoke. These eruptions typically occur about once every hour, with ash clouds rising as high as 8 kilometers into the sky.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The hike begins with a challenging 25-minute section that is steep, hilly, and rocky. Upon reaching the cone of Volcán Santa María, the route turns to the right for another 40 minutes. From this point onward, the trail toward the Santiaguito lookout passes through rolling hills and lush vegetation, offering impressive views along the way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The hike requires a minimum of two people, with a cost of Q250.00 per person. Trips depart daily at 6:00 PM and include private transportation from Casa Xelaju in Xela to the base of the hike. The same fee applies for each additional person, and participants should bring their own water.</p><a href="https://www.casaxelaju.com/hiking-volcan-santiaguito/"><b><span style="font-size: x-large;">Hike Volcano Santiaguito Quetzaltenango</span></b></a><br />
