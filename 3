<p>&nbsp;Pierre Antoine Jules was born in Gros-Morne, Haiti, on July 14, 1953. From an early age, his passion for music was evident as he became a member of his school choir between the ages of eleven and thirteen. In 1967, he moved to Port-au-Prince to continue his studies. The following year, during a vacation, he joined the group “Melomane de Gros-Morne,” where he began playing the conga. His musical journey deepened in July 1974 when he acquired his first guitar and taught himself to play.</p><iframe width="100%" height="550" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/li9YfjsagEk" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>&nbsp;In 1978, he migrated to Miami, Florida, where his career in music flourished. By May 1979, he had joined the Brothers Band as a guitarist and later co-founded the troubadour group Konbit Revolisyonè. His creative path continued as he performed with groups such as Grenn Banbou and Sanba Lele, both of which he helped establish. In May 1995, he created Baget Mayango, and in 2013, he founded Zetwal Kreyol Vocal Band to promote Haitian culture and its rich musical heritage.</p><iframe width="100%" height="550" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/38mF82j5C2s" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>&nbsp;As a band leader, singer, and guitarist, Pierre Antoine Jules introduced an innovative concept of Haitian Roots music that blended traditional folklore rhythms like Petro, Ibo, Kongo, and Rara with vibrant percussion and layered vocals. The music of Baget Mayango invites both listening and dancing, embodying a mission to share Haitian roots music with audiences around the world.</p>
