<p>&nbsp;The DELE (Diploma de Español como Lengua Extranjera) is an internationally recognized certification issued by Instituto Cervantes on behalf of the Spanish Ministry of Education. It evaluates Spanish proficiency across reading, listening, writing, speaking, grammar, vocabulary, and cultural understanding. Casa Xelajú’s preparation courses follow official DELE guidelines, ensuring that students receive targeted training for success in all components of the exam, including mock tests and essay coaching.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Each student receives dedicated attention from a single teacher, allowing for fully personalized feedback and instruction. The intensive program consists of five hours per day, five days per week, with lessons designed to simulate real exam conditions. Native-speaking instructors with up to 35 years of experience guide students through grammar drills, reading analysis, listening exercises, and oral practice, while weekend excursions and cultural workshops enhance real-world language skills.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Students live with Guatemalan host families, gaining valuable exposure to daily life and cultural context. Tuition includes 25 hours of private instruction per week and social activities, with optional homestay accommodations providing a private room and three meals per day from Monday to Saturday. Beginners typically require 10–14 weeks to reach an intermediate level, while advanced students preparing for C1 or C2 exams may study for 20 weeks or more. Short-term review courses of three to five weeks are available for experienced students seeking focused exam preparation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Casa Xelajú also offers preparation for other Spanish language tests, including Content Knowledge 0191, MTTC, OSAT, MTEL, ICTS, FTCE, NYSTCE, CLAD/BCLAD, Texas Oral Proficiency Test (TOPT), Praxis PPST, SAT II Spanish, FSI, and Oral Proficiency Interviews (OPI). The program emphasizes both language proficiency and cultural competence, ensuring that students not only succeed on the DELE exam but also gain a deeper understanding of Guatemalan society and daily life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Courses start every Monday year-round, and the program is primarily in-person to maximize immersion, although online options are available upon request. Through this intensive, culturally enriched approach, students develop fluency, exam readiness, and confidence in their Spanish skills while experiencing life in Guatemala.</p>
