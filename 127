<p>&nbsp;Casa Xelajú’s Cultural Exchange Experience enhances language learning by combining private instruction, family housing, and guided outings designed to create a natural and memorable environment for developing Spanish proficiency. After an assessment, each student receives a customized lesson plan using the GANAG template, detailing linguistic objectives, daily targets, evaluations, assignments, and homework. Teachers are extensively trained in student-centered instruction and rely on active learning strategies supported by technology, with each instructor equipped with a laptop to enrich the classroom experience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Students with limited time in Quetzaltenango may opt for accelerated Spanish, a faster-paced alternative requiring additional homework. Those who prefer a traditional format can choose Spanish for Travelers, and retirees may select a program tailored to their specific needs. College students and teachers seeking academic credit are directed to the Academic Program, while advanced learners may enroll in specialized classes focused on the Spanish subjunctive. Instruction throughout the program follows Stephen Krashen’s Comprehensive Input methodology, guiding students through a sequence that includes topic introduction, rule formation, instructor feedback, practice, quizzes, and assessments.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Casa Xelajú integrates the American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages (ACTFL) standards into its curriculum. These widely recognized standards enable instructors to clearly identify students’ proficiency levels from the outset, eliminating confusion and allowing classes to progress efficiently. With more than 35 years of teaching experience, instructors licensed by the Ministerio de Educación in Guatemala deliver lessons with expertise and enthusiasm. The school also offers an alternative curriculum for intermediate and advanced students interested in exploring Guatemala’s modern history, including topics such as genocide, repression, mining, poverty, corruption, and the overthrow of Jacobo Árbenz Guzmán. These studies provide context for understanding the social and political factors shaping the country.</p>

<p>&nbsp;Casa Xelajú supports education in local communities by allocating part of each student’s payment to rural schools in Aldea Francisco Vela, Nuevo Palmarcito, Caserío Guadalupe, and La Pedrera. Contributions help fund computer labs and internet access, allowing students to take required computer classes at their schools instead of paying for private instruction. The school has donated more than 60 computers and 20 musical instruments, helping over 400 children save a collective $40,000 annually. Testimonials, including those from visiting educators like Valerie Harley of Pennsylvania, highlight the positive impact of studying in Xelaju.</p>
<p>&nbsp;More than 45 Spanish courses are available, including preparation for exams such as the DELE, OPI, Praxis II, BCLAD, TOPT, FSI, SAT II, CLEP, and MTEL. Casa Xelajú is the only program in Guatemala with academic agreements with two major universities in the United States. Holidays are observed according to national labor laws, and students must pay for all five days of instruction during holiday weeks to comply with government regulations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The school’s one-on-one format extends to programs such as K’iche’ instruction, with all teachers trained to promote active participation. Additional offerings include test preparation for teachers, advanced Spanish, specialized fields of study, and Latin American literature. The official textbooks for Spanish I–IV are Spanish Now Level 1 and Spanish Now Level 2, accompanied by suggested reference materials such as a Spanish–English dictionary and 501 Spanish Verbs.</p><iframe width="100%" height="550" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Jn9oIOQ1EE4" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
