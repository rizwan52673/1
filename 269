<h1>Hike Volcano Santa Maria Guatemala</h1><p>&nbsp;Casa Xelajú offers a challenging and rewarding hiking experience to Volcán Santa María, one of Guatemala’s most demanding volcanic ascents. Located just south of Quetzaltenango, the volcano rises to 12,375 feet (3,772 meters) above sea level. The ascent typically requires up to four hours, with an additional two to three hours needed for the descent. Due to the steep terrain and high altitude, the climb is physically strenuous and requires strong physical and cardiovascular fitness.</p>

<p>&nbsp;The journey begins in Quetzaltenango, where transportation is provided to the nearby village of Llanos del Pinal. The hike starts with a moderately difficult trail leading to La Meseta, the point where the volcanic cone begins. As you ascend, expansive views of Quetzaltenango and the surrounding landscape unfold. Reaching the summit offers a panoramic vista of the Guatemalan highlands, more than twenty volcanoes, the coastal lowlands, and the neighboring active Santiaguito Volcano. The rocky summit also serves as a ceremonial site, where visitors may witness evangelical or Mayan ceremonies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The tour requires a minimum of two participants, with departures available at 5:00 AM for Q250.00 or $35.00 per person, and at 12:00 AM for Q300.00 or $40.00 per person. Cancellations must be made by 15:00 prior to the scheduled trip.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The midnight departure begins directly from the Casa Xelajú building, continuing to Llanos del Pinal before starting the ascent. The path to La Meseta is hilly and rocky without being overly steep, while the final stretch from La Meseta to the summit becomes significantly steeper and more demanding. The sunrise from the peak provides an unforgettable reward for the effort.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Participants should bring a reliable flashlight, sturdy hiking shoes, a warm winter coat, a backpack, plenty of water, snacks, and toilet paper. Due to the volcano’s microclimates, temperatures at the summit can be extremely cold, making proper preparation essential for a safe and enjoyable climb.</p>
