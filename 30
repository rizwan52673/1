Its creation was rooted in a vision for a better future for Guatemala and a desire to raise international awareness about the nation's political, social, and cultural realities. The founder, Julio E. Batres, originally from the small farming community of Aldea Francisco Vela, moved to Quetzaltenango in 1974 to complete his final year of high school after facing disciplinary issues for participating in a teacher’s strike in Retalhuleu. Determined to pursue education despite being labeled a troublemaker, he graduated and went on to study law at Universidad de San Carlos, where he became politically active through the Law Student Association, engaging in union organizing and protests against the military regime.</p><p>In 1979, Julio moved to the United States, driven by both job loss and concerns for his safety due to the political climate in Guatemala. Many of his friends and professors had been killed, and his involvement in activism made him fear for his life. While studying and working part-time in Milwaukee during the mid-1980s, he conceived the idea of opening a Spanish language school in Guatemala. The election of Vinicio Cerezo as the first civilian president in decades signaled a potential turning point, and in 1987, Julio returned to Guatemala with $1,000 to launch Casa de Español Xelajú. He began accepting students in December of that year.</p><p>Julio’s initial efforts to promote the school were modest but creative. He brought two boom-boxes from the U.S. to use for publicity, though one was confiscated during a layover in Mexico City. He sold the remaining stereo upon arrival in Quetzaltenango to fund advertising and rent a house. The school began with just two staff members—Julio and his sister Rosa Alicia, who handled teaching and teacher recruitment. Their goal was modest: ten students split between morning and afternoon sessions. However, Julio’s vision extended beyond language instruction; he wanted students to deeply understand Guatemala’s culture and political landscape.</p><p>Casa Xelajú partnered with the Guatemalan solidarity movement in the U.S., aiming to educate Americans about the country’s struggles and reduce U.S. support for the Guatemalan military. Many of the school’s first students were activists who needed Spanish for their work. Classes were enriched with cultural and social activities, including lectures and visits to unions and grassroots organizations. Students also volunteered with human rights groups, helping integrate computers into their operations—a significant contribution at a time when technology was scarce in Guatemala.</p><p>In 1989, student volunteers participated in construction work in Canton Francisco Vela, helping repair a road that became nearly impassable during the rainy season. They worked alongside the local community committee on weekends and returned to classes during the week. Later, the school initiated a community project in La Pedrera, thanks to a connection made by teacher Magdalena Salazar. After engaging with the community, Casa Xelajú developed a lasting relationship and began supporting local initiatives.</p><p>Initially, the school faced slow growth due to limited tourism and ongoing political repression. In the late 1970s, other Spanish schools in Xela had closed because of the civil war, and only informal instruction remained. However, Casa Xelajú gradually gained traction by attracting individuals involved in Latin American solidarity movements, such as NISGUA and CISPES, as well as Spanish teachers and university students from the U.S. The school expanded from hosting 15 students per week in the summer to 40, eventually requiring the rental of two buildings to accommodate the growing demand.</p><p>Through perseverance and a commitment to education and social justice, Casa Xelajú evolved into a respected institution that not only teaches Spanish but also fosters cultural understanding and community engagement.</p><a href="https://www.casaxelaju.com/"><b><span style="font-size: x-large;">Study Spanish Guatemala</span></b></a><br />
