Students receive one-on-one instruction tailored to their level and goals, while living with local families for full cultural immersion. The program follows a standardized Spanish I–IV curriculum, which is available for download, and includes daily cultural activities, weekend excursions, and community engagement. This structure is ideal for learners seeking a gradual yet immersive experience.</p><p>Upon arrival, students undergo an initial assessment, after which their teacher creates a personalized lesson plan using the GANAG template. This plan outlines weekly linguistic objectives, daily learning goals, evaluations, homework, and assignments. Casa Xelajú’s instructors are extensively trained in student-centered instruction, encouraging active participation and faster learning. Each teacher is equipped with a laptop to integrate technology into the classroom experience.</p><p>For those with limited time, Casa Xelajú offers an accelerated Spanish program with a faster pace and more homework. Alternatively, the Spanish for Travelers program allows students to customize their learning experience, and there are specialized options for retirees. College students and educators seeking academic credit can explore the Academic Program, while advanced learners may opt to study the Spanish subjunctive.</p><p>The teaching methodology is based on Stephen Krashen’s “Comprehensive Input” approach, which emphasizes understanding before production. Lessons follow a structured process: topic introduction, rule formation, feedback, multimedia reinforcement, practice, quizzes, and evaluations. Homework and tests are used to identify and reinforce weak areas. Casa Xelajú also incorporates the American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages (ACTFL) standards, ensuring high-quality instruction aligned with global best practices.</p><p>With over 35 years of experience, Casa Xelajú’s licensed teachers deliver lessons with enthusiasm and expertise. The school offers a unique curriculum for intermediate to advanced students interested in Guatemalan history and current events, including topics such as genocide, repression, mining, poverty, corruption, and the CIA’s role in overthrowing Jacobo Arbenz Guzmán. This historical perspective enriches students' understanding of the country’s social and political landscape.</p><p>Casa Xelajú is committed to social impact. A portion of tuition fees supports rural schools in Aldea Francisco Vela, Nuevo Palmarcito, Caserio Guadalupe, and La Pedrera Community Project. These funds help maintain computer labs and internet access, making technology education more accessible. The school has donated over 60 computers and 20 musical instruments, benefiting more than 400 children and saving families approximately $40,000 annually.</p><p>The program offers over 45 Spanish courses, including test preparation for DELE, OPI, Praxis II, BCLAD, TOPT, FSI, SAT II, CLEP, MTEL, and more. ACTFL standards help assess students’ language levels accurately, minimizing confusion and maximizing learning efficiency from day one. Casa Xelajú is the only program in Guatemala with academic agreements with two major U.S. universities.</p><p>Classes are not held on national holidays, but tuition still applies for those days in accordance with labor laws. The school offers specialized programs such as Spanish for Business, Health Care Workers, Christian Spanish, and Spanish for Children. Instruction is one-on-one, and even Quiche (K’iche’) teachers are trained in student-centered methods to enhance learning outcomes.</p><p>Additional offerings include Spanish test preparation for teachers, advanced Spanish, and Latin American literature courses. Official textbooks for Spanish I–IV include “Spanish Now, Level 1” and “Spanish Now, Level 2,” along with recommended resources like a Spanish-English dictionary and “501 Spanish Verbs” by Christopher Kendris.</p><p>Tuition covers five hours of daily instruction, private study rooms with scenic views, three hours of cultural activities, homestay accommodations with meals and a private room, translation services, unlimited Wi-Fi, affordable international calls, lectures, conferences, guide fees, and complimentary organic coffee, tea, and bread during breaks. Students also have access to a library with over 1,000 books and nearly 200 educational DVDs and videos. Laundry services and weaving lessons are available for an additional fee.</p><p>Casa Xelajú’s programs are fully accredited by the Guatemalan Ministry of Education. The school offers specialized courses tailored to individual needs, including a Spanish Literature Program, Semester Abroad, Educators Program, High School Program, and College Credit options. If students have interests beyond the listed programs, Casa Xelajú is happy to help design a customized curriculum to meet their goals.</p><a href="https://www.casaxelaju.com/spanish-immersion-program-in-guatemala-learn-in-xela/"><b><span style="font-size: x-large;">Spanish Immersion School Guatemala</span></b></a><br />
