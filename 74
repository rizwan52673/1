<h1>Hike Volcan Tajumulco Guatemala</h1><p>&nbsp;Hiking Volcán Tajumulco in Guatemala offers the remarkable fulfillment of reaching the highest volcano in Central America. Standing at 4,202 meters (13,786 ft) and crowned with two summits, Tajumulco rewards visitors with a breathtaking sunrise and sweeping views of more than six surrounding volcanoes, including 7 Orejas, Santa María, Santiaguito, Santo Tomás, Laguna Chicabal, and others. Watching dawn unfold from the summit creates a vivid display of color and light, often leaving hikers with a profound sense of connection to nature.</p><iframe width="100%" height="550" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ec36XXNtI8Y" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>&nbsp;The one-day hike requires a minimum of two participants and costs Q500.00 per person, or US$68.00, with departure at 4:00 a.m. The two-day hike also requires a minimum of two people and is priced at Q650.00 per person, or US$85.00, departing at 6:00 a.m. Both options include private transportation from the Casa Xelajú building to the base of the volcano.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The two-day trek to the summits begins with an early departure from Quetzaltenango at 4:30 a.m., followed by a walk to La Terminal bus station to board a traditional “chicken bus” to San Marcos. The ride takes approximately two hours. Private transportation is also available from Quetzaltenango to Chuan for those who prefer a more comfortable alternative to the crowded bus. After stopping for breakfast in San Marcos, the journey continues with another bus ride to the small town of Christian, located about six kilometers from the summit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The initial kilometer of the hike is relatively gentle, but the second kilometer becomes steep and rocky. Carrying a backpack can slow progress, and for those who prefer extra support, mule rentals are available in town to help transport gear. The group will spend the night at base camp, located 250 meters below the summits, before beginning the final ascent at 4:00 a.m. the next morning. The summit is known for strong winds and cold temperatures, but the extraordinary sunrise and panoramic mountain and volcano views make the effort deeply rewarding.</p>
<p>&nbsp;All proceeds are donated to the La Pedrera Community Project, a non-profit organization that offers after-school academic assistance and computer classes to more than sixty children. Donations are tax-deductible in the United States, and additional information is available at www.lapedreraschoolproject.com, Private transportation from Quetzaltenango to Chuan is also offered upon request.</p>
<p>&nbsp;For those seeking a shorter journey, a hiking option is available with private transportation directly from our building or your hotel to Tajumulco, a town closer to the summit. This significantly reduces travel time from Xela to the base and onwards to the summit. Details are available upon inquiry.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The donation includes one night of lodging in our building with communal accommodations for sleeping bags, four meals, ground transportation, and a guide. Participants should bring a reliable flashlight, sturdy hiking shoes, a winter coat, a backpack, a sleeping bag, ample water, snacks, and toilet paper. Due to the presence of microclimates, the summit area can be extremely cold and windy.</p>
