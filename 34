<p>&nbsp;The HONR Network was founded by Lenny Pozner after the tragic Sandy Hook massacre. Initially, its purpose was to stop the ongoing harassment and emotional torment faced by the families of victims who became targets of online hate and hoax campaigns. Over time, as other mass-casualty events occurred and more families sought help, the organization expanded its mission to support anyone affected by online harassment and abuse. Today, the HONR Network works to provide education, guidance, and advocacy to victims, professionals, and policymakers to create a safer and more inclusive internet environment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Since its creation, the HONR Network has played a crucial role in removing tens of thousands of harmful and illegal pieces of online content, including posts, videos, and images designed to harass or intimidate victims and their families. The organization assists victims of various forms of cybercrime such as harassment, revenge porn, and stalking, offering removal support and guidance. In addition, HONR Network collaborates with major social media companies to improve reporting systems, enhance removal processes, and develop better policies to protect victims—particularly in the immediate aftermath of violent or highly publicized events when they are most vulnerable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Lenny Pozner has also pursued legal action against harassers and hoaxers, helping to establish legal precedents that make it easier for other victims of online abuse to hold offenders accountable in court. These efforts not only bring justice but also strengthen the framework for online safety and protection.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The HONR Network operates as a non-partisan organization, independent of any political party or affiliation. Its members and volunteers represent diverse political views, unified by a shared goal of combating online hate. While the organization was born out of the attacks on the Sandy Hook victims’ families, it does not affiliate with any other Sandy Hook-related charities or external causes. Individual board members may participate in their own philanthropic or political initiatives, but these activities are separate from the HONR Network’s work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The statistics featured on the HONR Network website come from credible and respected sources in addition to its own internal data. These include research from the Pew Research Center, Data & Society Research Institute, Fight the New Drug, The Washington Post, the A. James Clark School of Engineering, and other institutions that study online harassment and digital abuse.</p><a id="dynamicLink" href="" style="font-size:24px"></a>

<p>&nbsp;Those wishing to support the HONR Network can do so in several ways. Practicing responsible social media behavior and reporting cyber aggression are valuable contributions. Supporters can report harmful content directly to social media platforms, use the HONR Network’s online tools to flag illegal content, or participate in the organization’s community efforts such as the HONR Forum. Wearing HONR apparel or joining as a volunteer are also meaningful ways to contribute. Professionals with relevant expertise can volunteer their services to assist victims directly, while others can help identify and report hate and harassment online.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Financial donations are vital to the HONR Network’s operations. The organization relies on public contributions to continue its mission of protecting victims, supporting survivors, and fostering a safer digital environment. Each donation helps fund programs focused on education, empowerment, and advocacy, ensuring that more individuals and families can be shielded from the damaging effects of online hate and harassment.</p>
