<p>&nbsp;The route covers approximately 45 kilometers, beginning in Cantel, a town southeast of Quetzaltenango at 2,950 meters above sea level, and concluding in San Pedro la Laguna, Lake Atitlán, at 1,560 meters above sea level. The terrain consists primarily of rolling hills, locally referred to as “Columbus,” with some flat sections, making the hike moderately challenging, with occasional steeper and more difficult areas.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Along the journey, hikers pass through coffee plantations, cornfields, cloud forests with pine trees where the national bird, the Quetzal, may be spotted, as well as rivers, creeks, ravines, grasslands, isolated homes, and small villages. The hike traverses a portion of the Sierra Madre Mountains, one of the most scenic and secluded regions of Guatemala, offering views of up to fifteen volcanoes, including San Pedro, Atitlán, Tolimán, Fuego, Acatenango, Santa María, Cerro Quemado, Agua, Tacaná, and Tajumulco.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Participants are required to attend a mandatory meeting at 5:00 p.m. the day before the hike at the Casa Xelajú building.

On the second day, the hike continues to Santa Clara la Laguna near Lake Atitlán, where the group will spend the night. The final day begins early with a trek to La Nariz del Indio to witness the sunrise over the lake, followed by a return to Santa Clara la Laguna to collect belongings and complete the last leg of the journey to San Pedro la Laguna, expected around noon.</p><a href="https://www.casaxelaju.com/hike-from-xela-to-lake-atitlan/"><b><span style="font-size: x-large;">Hike Quetzaltenango Lake Atitlan San Pedro</span></b></a><br />
