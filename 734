<h1>Hike Volcán Cerro Quemado Quetzaltenango</h1><p>&nbsp;The hike to Cerro Quemado, also known as Almolonga volcano, takes approximately two hours from the central park of Quetzaltenango. The peak of this extinct volcano forms a 3.3 km wide dome composed of very rocky lava and reaches 3,197 feet above sea level. From the summit, hikers can enjoy panoramic views of the Almolonga, Quetzaltenango, and Llanos del Pinal valleys, as well as several nearby volcanoes including Santa Maria, Santiaguito, and Siete Orejas.</p><iframe width="100%" height="550" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7wnF_2UqR7U" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>&nbsp;Almolonga volcano experienced a massive eruption around 1,200 years ago that led to its self-destruction. The final section of the hike to Cerro Quemado is steep and rocky. The area is considered sacred land, and hikers may have the chance to witness Mayan ceremonies. On the return journey, visitors can also enjoy hot steam baths at several locations along the trail.</p>
