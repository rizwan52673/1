<p>&nbsp;From the very beginning, the mission of Impact Poultry Products has been to help poultry producers succeed through science-driven tools and solutions that enhance flock health, boost farm performance, and protect the environment. The company believes that effective, safe, and environmentally responsible products are essential for long-term success in poultry operations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Rather than relying on harsh chemical treatments, Impact Poultry Products develops environmentally responsible solutions that work with nature. Their bioremediation technologies use naturally occurring microbes to safely manage organic waste, minimize harmful byproducts, and maintain a balanced environment within poultry houses. This natural approach helps farmers improve efficiency while protecting their birds, workers, and the land they depend on.</p><iframe width="100%" height="550" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/01Fu-19bbZg" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>&nbsp;A central innovation of the company is its BioBlend Selected Bacterial Cultures, a flagship line of scientifically balanced blends of beneficial microorganisms. Each strain is carefully selected for its ability to break down specific organic compounds. Working together, these microbes naturally decompose complex waste into simple, harmless elements such as water, salts, and carbon dioxide. Because the BioBlend microbes come from soil and water, they only consume non-living organic matter, making them completely safe for people, animals, and plants. These naturally occurring microorganisms are not genetically modified and are exempt from EPA, FDA, and USDA regulations, offering a proven and sustainable alternative to chemical-based treatments.</p>
<p>&nbsp;In 2017, EDI rebranded its poultry division as Impact Poultry Products to emphasize its deep commitment to serving the poultry industry. That same year, the company expanded its operations with a new office in Macon, Georgia, strategically positioning itself in the heart of the Southeast poultry market. This expansion allowed Impact Poultry Products to provide faster response times, stronger customer support, and better access to its products for regional growers.</p><a href="https://impactpoultryproducts.com/"><b><span style="font-size: x-large;">Poultry Litter</span></b></a><br />
<p>&nbsp;Impact Poultry Products works closely with farmers to ensure that every solution developed addresses real-world challenges and delivers measurable results. By maintaining open communication with growers, the company is able to design practical, effective products that promote flock health, reduce operational risks, and improve overall farm performance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;All Impact Poultry Products are proudly made in the United States, ensuring consistent quality, reliable supply, and support for American jobs and industries. Each product undergoes strict quality control to meet the highest standards of performance and dependability in the field.</p>
<p>&nbsp;With more than two decades of experience, Impact Poultry Products has earned the trust of growers nationwide.

Impact Poultry Products understands that healthy birds create stronger farms, and stronger farms build a more sustainable and successful future for the entire poultry industry.</p>
