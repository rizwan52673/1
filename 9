<p>&nbsp;Every donation helps expand programs that teach students and educators to recognize warning signs of potential violence and how to seek help. The organization strives to reduce social isolation, build stronger connections in schools, and promote kindness and inclusion. With ongoing support, Sandy Hook Promise continues to advocate for bipartisan gun safety reforms and to implement their Say Something Anonymous Reporting System in more schools nationwide.</p>
<p>&nbsp;There are multiple ways to give. Donations can be made directly online, by check, or through PayPal, Apple Pay, and other digital options. Contributions may also be made in honor or memory of loved ones, as part of the Impact Circle or Promise Circle programs, or through planned giving such as wills and trusts. Corporate partnerships, foundation grants, and employee matching programs offer additional opportunities to support their cause. Donors may also give through stock transfers, Donor Advised Funds, or cryptocurrency, and international donations are accepted as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Sandy Hook Promise operates as a recognized top-rated nonprofit organization, and contributions to the Sandy Hook Promise Foundation are tax-deductible. For those who wish to support advocacy work, the Sandy Hook Promise Action Fund, a 501(c)(4) organization, channels donations toward public policy and educational campaigns to prevent gun violence, though these contributions are not tax-deductible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The movement welcomes volunteers and supporters who want to make a lasting difference. Whether joining the Promise to protect children, organizing fundraisers, or sharing personal stories to raise awareness, each action contributes to preventing tragedies before they happen. The organization also offers resources for educators and students to engage in prevention efforts and create schools where everyone feels safe and included.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Since its founding after the tragic Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in 2012, Sandy Hook Promise has worked to honor the victims by ensuring other families never experience similar loss. The organization has helped stop numerous potential school shootings and saved lives through early intervention. At a time when gun violence remains a leading cause of death among children, continued public support is essential.</p>
