<h1>Sandy Hook Hoax</h1><p>&nbsp;A year and a half after the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, Lenny Pozner reached out to arrange a meeting with Wolfgang Halbig. Halbig, a 68-year-old security consultant, had become the informal leader of a community of conspiracy theorists who insisted that the shooting was staged by the government. These hoaxers claimed the 26 people killed that day were merely fictional, including Pozner’s six-year-old son, Noah. On May 28, 2014, while on a business trip in Florida, Pozner hoped to sit down with Halbig at a coffee shop near his Orlando home. He wanted to speak face-to-face about Noah, his only son, who remained constantly on his mind. Pozner remembered dropping Noah off at school on the morning of December 14, 2012, listening to the boy’s favorite song, “Gangnam Style,” during the drive. He had told Noah to have a fun day and watched him walk inside, adjusting his backpack and brown jacket.</p>
<p>&nbsp;From the beginning, Pozner had struggled with the hoaxers. He often posted photographs of Noah on his Google Plus page — pictures of him smiling, hugging his twin sister, playing at the beach, or proudly holding the tooth he had recently lost. These images drew cruel responses from conspiracy theorists. Some asked where Noah would “die next,” while others assumed Pozner was being paid to help fabricate the shooting. Unlike most Sandy Hook parents, Pozner confronted these accusations directly. He posted Noah’s birth and death certificates, the medical examiner’s report, and even one of his report cards, but hoaxers dismissed the documents as forgeries.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Pozner kept trying. He believed that if he met Halbig in person and showed him the documents directly, perhaps Halbig and others would finally give up their claims. He wanted complete transparency and felt that withholding information would only reinforce the conspiracy theories. When Halbig never responded, Pozner contacted Kelley Watt, a particularly aggressive conspiracy theorist. She replied that Halbig would speak to him only if he exhumed Noah’s body to prove his son had truly died.</p>
<p>&nbsp;With a meeting no longer possible, Pozner tried engaging the people who had made him their primary target. At one point, a video circulated online showing images of Noah accompanied by pornographic audio. In June 2014, Pozner joined a private Facebook group called “Sandy Hook Hoax” to answer questions. He lasted only minutes. Participants mocked him, accused him of being part of a money-making scheme, and hurled abusive insults at his family. It became clear that Halbig and the others viewed all of this as a never-ending game. Pozner realized he would have to spend the rest of his life protecting his son’s memory.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Major tragedies often produce conspiracy theories rooted in the belief that governments stage horrific events to control the population. Within a day of the mass shooting in San Bernardino, online videos labeled the attack a hoax and quickly gained thousands of views. Similar claims followed the 2007 shooting at Virginia Tech and the 2012 Aurora movie theater attack, with conspiracy theorists suggesting government involvement. Even a sheriff who investigated the 2015 mass shooting at Umpqua Community College had previously shared mass-shooting conspiracy theories on Facebook.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Still, the theories surrounding Sandy Hook became uniquely extreme. Within weeks, a YouTube video titled “The Sandy Hook Shooting — Fully Exposed” reached millions of viewers. Some of the hoaxers were motivated by fear that the tragedy would lead to tighter gun regulations. Conspiracy theorist James Fetzer called the massacre a government drill, and rhetoric from gun-rights organizations further inflamed these suspicions. In February 2012, months before the shooting, NRA executive Wayne LaPierre claimed that President Obama’s real goal was to win re-election and then eliminate the Second Amendment altogether.</p>
<p>&nbsp;In the aftermath, Halbig launched sandyhookjustice.com. He promoted himself as a former school security director in Seminole County, Florida, and claimed involvement in the Columbine shooting investigation. He presented himself as uniquely qualified to expose government lies. Hoaxers rallied around him, donating large sums to his fundraising campaigns, while Alex Jones championed him as a leading expert. Halbig repeatedly asked sixteen supposed “unanswered” questions, many of which were clearly addressed in the official Connecticut State Police report. Questions about emergency responders entering the school or helicopter use were all answered, but Halbig dismissed anything produced by authorities as inherently false.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Unable to challenge government agencies effectively, hoaxers turned their attacks toward victims’ families. They accused grieving parents of being government operatives and claimed they showed improper emotion during interviews. They misinterpreted technical glitches, such as time-stamping errors on memorial pages, as evidence of pre-planning. They even circulated a photograph of a living girl, insisting it proved her dead sister had never died. Their scrutiny extended into deeply personal spaces. They analyzed the details of Noah’s funeral, suggesting that a private open-casket viewing violated Jewish tradition and was therefore proof that Noah had not existed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;As the harassment escalated, Pozner began to fight back. While independent blogs emerged to debunk conspiracy claims, Pozner worked closely with their authors. This effort became a form of emotional release, a way for him to manage his grief. He filed police reports against harassers, publicly posting the documents to deter further abuse. Most cases went nowhere legally, but often the visibility alone persuaded offenders to remove defamatory content.</p>
<p>&nbsp;In the summer of 2014, two months after offering to meet Halbig, Pozner filed a complaint with the Florida attorney general accusing Halbig of defrauding donors by claiming the shooting was a hoax. After learning of the complaint, Halbig repeatedly called Pozner, leaving urgent messages. Although Halbig later denied contacting him, Pozner kept the recordings. Shortly after the two-year anniversary of the shooting, a poster of Noah appeared at a vigil in Pakistan following a mass attack there. Pozner suspected it was meant as a gesture of solidarity, but hoaxers seized on the image, calling Noah “the boy who was killed twice.” Halbig posted the photo on his website, and eventually published Pozner’s attorney-general complaint, exposing his personal contact information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Pozner sued Halbig in September 2015. The resulting injunction forced Halbig to remove the complaint from the internet. Halbig responded by deleting his entire website, only to launch a new one a month later and continue his attacks. Pozner viewed this as deliberate provocation. When Halbig republished photographs of Noah, Pozner notified the hosting company, and the images were removed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Determined to counter the spread of hoaxer content, Pozner founded the HONR Network. Its mission is to expose harassment and protect victims of mass tragedies from online abuse. Since existing laws offer little protection, Pozner and volunteers scour the internet for harmful videos or posts and report them for violating platform rules. Their progress is slow, but they have succeeded in removing hundreds of links. Pozner believes it is essential to prevent false narratives from solidifying over time and erasing the reality of his son’s life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;In November, the HONR Network published an extensive digital report on Halbig, detailing inconsistencies in his background, including the absence of evidence supporting his claimed involvement in the Columbine investigation. The report also uncovered that during his time as a school security director, his gun was once stolen by a student — an embarrassing incident he publicly acknowledged. Halbig maintained that he was merely an investigator with good intentions and denied any association with conspiracy theorists.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Years later, Pozner saw how his struggle foreshadowed a broader cultural shift. When he first encountered hoaxers, it seemed unimaginable that conspiracy thinking could become so widespread and openly hostile to truth. He warned repeatedly that the movement was growing and needed to be contained, but it expanded into mainstream political life instead. Over time, Pozner continued pressing his fight. A prominent conspiracy theorist he helped expose lost his university position. Another individual who threatened Pozner received a prison sentence. Pozner spoke publicly in major publications, further risking harassment, and he and his volunteers pushed large platforms like YouTube to remove harmful content. Their efforts have also drawn attention to the corporate systems that allow such theories to flourish. Pozner hopes to one day help establish legal protections that classify targeted attacks on the families of mass-shooting victims as hate crimes.</p><a href="https://www.thetrace.org/2017/12/what-kind-of-person-calls-the-sandy-hook-shooting-a-hoax/"><b><span style="font-size: x-large;">Sandy Hook Hoax</span></b></a><br />
