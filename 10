<p>&nbsp;The HONR Network was established by Lenny Pozner after the Sandy Hook massacre. Its initial mission was to stop the continuous harassment and cruelty faced by the families of victims who were being tormented online by hoax and hate groups. As more mass-casualty events occurred and additional victims’ families faced similar abuse, the organization broadened its mission to include helping those affected by such harassment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Over time, the HONR Network’s mission has evolved to support and guide anyone affected by online harassment, hate campaigns, and victimization. It also works to educate professionals who handle harassment issues in workplaces and academic settings, and to assist policymakers and online platforms in developing safer, more inclusive digital spaces.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Since its inception, the HONR Network has successfully facilitated the removal of tens of thousands of harmful online materials such as posts, images, videos, and blogs that were designed to harass or intimidate survivors and victims’ families. The organization has also helped victims of other online crimes like stalking, revenge porn, and coordinated hate campaigns. Through its efforts, it continues to serve as a crucial line of defense against online hate and abuse.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The HONR Network has established strong partnerships with major social media and online platform providers, helping them refine their content removal procedures and improve policies to protect victims, especially following mass-casualty or high-profile violent incidents. Lenny Pozner has also worked to bring perpetrators of online harassment to justice through legal action, setting important precedents that empower other victims to take similar steps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The HONR Network is non-partisan and has no affiliation with any political party. Its board members and volunteers come from a wide range of political backgrounds. It is also not affiliated with any other organizations or causes, including those specifically connected to Sandy Hook, although it was founded in response to harassment stemming from that tragedy. Members of its board may engage in their own philanthropic or political efforts, but these do not represent the organization’s affiliations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Statistics featured on the HONR Network’s website are gathered from both internal research and credible external sources such as the Pew Research Center, Data & Society Research Institute, Fight the New Drug, Washington Post, A James Clark School of Engineering, and Brandon Gaille’s reports on cyberstalking.</p><a id="dynamicLink" href="" style="font-size:24px"></a>

<p>&nbsp;Supporters can help financially in various ways. One of the simplest is by practicing responsible social media behavior and reporting incidents of cyber aggression when witnessed. People can reach out to political representatives, report abuse directly to platforms, join the HONR Forum to assist with content removal, or use HONR’s online reporting tool to alert the organization to harmful material. Additionally, supporters can contribute by purchasing HONR apparel from the organization’s shop.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The HONR Network relies on the commitment of volunteers and donors. Professionals with relevant expertise can offer their services to victims, while others can volunteer to identify and remove hate content through HONR’s private forum or volunteer forms. Donations of any size help fund the organization’s programs, advocacy, and educational initiatives aimed at protecting survivors and families while building a safer online environment for everyone.</p>
