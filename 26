<h1>Hike from Quetzaltenango (Xela) to Lake Atitlán</h1>
<p>&nbsp;The three-day hike from Xela to Lake Atitlán offers an unforgettable journey through the stunning landscapes of the Guatemalan highlands. It provides a rare chance to experience the natural beauty of the region while observing indigenous communities that continue to live traditionally in isolated villages between Quetzaltenango (Xela) and Lake Atitlán (San Pedro la Laguna). This adventure not only offers healthy physical activity but also the refreshing experience of breathing clean, unpolluted mountain air, far from the congestion of cities and industrial areas.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The 45-kilometer trek begins in Cantel, a town southeast of Quetzaltenango situated at 2,950 meters above sea level, and ends in San Pedro la Laguna at 1,560 meters above sea level. The terrain consists of rolling hills with occasional flat stretches, making the journey moderately challenging with a few more demanding sections. Along the route, hikers pass through coffee farms, cornfields, pine-filled cloud forests where it is sometimes possible to spot the Quetzal—the national bird of Guatemala—rivers, ravines, meadows, and scattered rural homes and villages.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The hike traverses part of the Sierra Madre Mountains, one of Guatemala’s most beautiful and remote natural regions. From various points along the trail, it is possible to see as many as fifteen volcanoes, including San Pedro, Atitlán, Tolimán, Fuego, Acatenango, Santa María, Cerro Quemado, Agua, Tacaná, and Tajumulco.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Before departure, there is a mandatory meeting at 5:00 p.m. the day before the hike at the Casa Xelajú building. The group departs at 6:00 a.m. for Xecam, Cantel, where the trek begins. The first night is spent in the Chisib’el community. On the second day, hikers continue to Santa Clara la Laguna, near Lake Atitlán, where they will stay overnight. The final day begins early with a hike up La Nariz del Indio to watch the sunrise over the lake before returning to Santa Clara la Laguna to collect belongings and continue the final leg to San Pedro la Laguna, arriving around noon.</p>
<p>&nbsp;During the journey, participants will have the opportunity to bathe in a traditional temazcal (sauna) and share meals with local families who prepare homemade food, including fresh tortillas and beans. The cost of the trip is Q840.00 per person (approximately US$110.00), based on a minimum of two participants, with departure at 6:00 a.m. The package includes six meals, two nights of lodging, a sleeping bag, and transportation from San Pedro to Quetzaltenango if needed. The guides will prepare lunches and provide water throughout the trip. A cancellation fee applies if canceled within 24 hours of departure.</p>
