<p>&nbsp;Students participate in personalized Spanish lessons focused on medical vocabulary, patient interaction, and healthcare terminology. Classes are held five hours a day, five days a week, with a maximum ratio of three students per teacher to ensure personalized attention. Alongside classroom instruction, participants visit hospitals, clinics, pharmacies, and community health centers, where they can observe and engage in real-life medical conversations. These experiences help students gain confidence and fluency in communicating with patients and healthcare professionals in Spanish-speaking environments.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The program also emphasizes cultural understanding through full immersion. Participants stay with local Guatemalan host families, providing daily opportunities to practice Spanish and experience authentic local life. Outside of class, the program includes cultural tours and excursions to destinations such as Lake Atitlán, Antigua, and various Mayan ruins. These activities introduce students to Guatemala’s rich traditions, indigenous medical practices, and diverse communities, offering valuable cultural context for effective patient care.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Each session runs for two or three weeks, beginning in July, with options for extended stays. The program fee covers tuition, homestay accommodations with meals, local transportation, guided excursions, museum and park entry, and other cultural experiences. Airfare is not included.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The program is coordinated by bilingual educator Chris Perry, who brings more than 30 years of experience in teaching and immersion-based education. Participants receive continuous guidance and support throughout their stay to ensure a rewarding and productive experience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;This Medical Spanish Immersion Program is ideal for healthcare professionals seeking to improve their language skills and cultural competence. By learning in an immersive, real-world setting, participants return home with a stronger command of Spanish and a deeper understanding of the patients and communities they serve.</p>
